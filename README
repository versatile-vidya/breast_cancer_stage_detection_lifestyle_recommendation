#  Breast Cancer Stage Detection and lifesytle 

This project uses a deep learning model to automatically detect, segment, and analyze breast cancer from medical images (e.g., mammograms).
 The model also estimates tumor size, classifies the cancer stage, and provides personalized health recommendations (diet, exercise, and yoga) based on the stage.
